You have updated to the new version.

The new version has been revised as follows:

===
Join the ability to actively update feeds
The previous feed was a passive refresh (you started requesting feed data when you opened the channel), and now you can turn on proactive caching in Settings -> Data Settings.
After the active cache is turned on, the software reads the cached content first, and the background is turned on, and the feed is refreshed every 15 minutes, which ensures timeliness and greatly increases the loading speed of the article.
However, the background is only opened in the network state of non-billing traffic (such as WIFI or wired network).
===

1. Adjust the display UI of the sidebar of the article details page
2. Optimize the operational logic of the switch reading state

If the software makes you feel great, don't forget to give me praise and recommend it to your friends. 

Thank you :)
