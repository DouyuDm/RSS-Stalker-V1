The new version has been revised as follows:

1. Add a reading progress bar at the top of the article details screen
2. Add a shortcut to the article details page:

	← ：View previous article
	→ ：View next article
	Esc ：Back to article list

3. Custom page time fixes, stability fixes, optimized memory footprint, etc.

Thank you :)
