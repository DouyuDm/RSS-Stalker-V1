You have updated to the new version.

The new version has been revised as follows:

===
Increase the default full-text list.
In the channel menu, you can add the current channel to the full-text list. This way, each time you open an article in the channel, it will crawl the page data and convert it into readable text by default.
===

1. Improve option switching for the settings page, adding push lists and full-text lists to the pivot
2. Add configuration entry for Baidu translation in the settings
3. English text correction and partial style fine-tuning

Thank you :)
