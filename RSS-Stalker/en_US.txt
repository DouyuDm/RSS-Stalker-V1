You have updated to the new version.

The new version has been revised as follows:

add the option for automatic caching. You can open it in the settings, so every time you open the channel, the software will automatically help you cache the articles in the current channel.

---

Recently, the "free combination channel content" and "read/unread options" functions have been prepared, and the update frequency has been reduced (probably)

If the software makes you feel great, don't forget to give me praise and recommend it to your friends. 

Thank you :)

That's all, good luck.
