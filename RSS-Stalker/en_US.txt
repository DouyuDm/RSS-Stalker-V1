You have updated to the new version.

The new version has been revised as follows:

1. The article details page provides the priority of Chinese to English and English to Chinese.
2. Changed the way the translated card is displayed. Now you need to manually close it and copy the translated content.
3. Adjust the trigger mode under the touch screen to make the pop-up menu more “follow the hand”

Thank you :)
