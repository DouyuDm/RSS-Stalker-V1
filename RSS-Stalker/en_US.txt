You have updated to the new version.

The new version has been revised as follows:

1. Unblocked links, but all links will open with the default browser when clicked
2. Select the text pop-up menu to add two new options 'Search in web' and 'Share', and you can set the default search engine in the settings.
3. Move the Open Web Page button to the sidebar resident button list
4. Fixed an issue where the sidebar could not be loaded correctly when opening an article from the timeline

That's all, good luck.
