You have updated to the new version.

The new version has been revised as follows:

1. Increase the channel icon display
2. Increase the display of the unread items of the category and channel (loading will be performed at startup, and the loading progress will be displayed in the sidebar)
3. Adjust the data loading mode of the custom page, and read the local cache first.
4. Fix some feeds image loading failures

Thank you :)
