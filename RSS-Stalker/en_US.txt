You have updated to the new version.

The new version has been revised as follows:

1. Provide translation of the word in the article, and people who read the other language article can be cool.
2. You can set your favorite channel as the home page, and the entry is in the channel's right-click menu.
3. Fixed the performance of the <pre> tag. Now the code block can be displayed normally. If the <pre> tag identifies the language, it can also be highlighted by syntax.
4. Adjusted the visual performance of other article lists in the article details page to avoid button occlusion articles

That's all, good luck.
