You have updated to the new version.

The new version has been revised as follows:

1. The article can now customize the font family and font size. The entry is in the settings button on the sidebar of the article details page.
2. Push notification UI adjustment, support picture display
3. Entry page (Binding OneDrive) UI adjustment
4. Adjust the cache display logic. The cache that has been stored for more than 20 minutes is considered as expired cache and will not be displayed first.

Thank you :)
