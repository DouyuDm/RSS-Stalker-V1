You have updated to the new version.

The new version has been revised as follows:

1. Fix the exception that failed to get data when opening the feed
2. Now read/unread articles can be distinguished on the title (the title of the unread article is lighter)
3. The bottom of the sidebar is now increasing to show the current total number of feeds.
4. An optional operation - Click the mouse side button to return to the previous page (the cursor can not be placed in the reading page, it will be intercepted)

Thank you :)
